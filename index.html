                  <p> I started programming since I turned 16, it was a way to ignore all of the boring classes I had to take in order to graduate, when I was young the only career path that was clear to me was solving problems with technology. Even tho I didn't know how to solve certain problems, my stuborness would help me walk and find a solution to whatever script I was stuck with. All of the programing languages I learned, all of the languages I speak, all of the frameworks I worked with and all of the experience I got, was not me trying to achieve a goal, it was me trying to learn something i didn't know, what moves me is my aspiration for knowledge.
